aethercast (0.1+16.10.20160520.1-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * Some times socket output buffer was full and sending returned an
    EAGAIN error. Solved by making the socket blocking, as anyway we
    have a dedicated thread for sending and you will not be blocked in a
    datagram socket for long. LP: #1579773. (LP: #1579773)
